                    <span class="first-character">D</span>ata Structures and Algorithms play a very important role in computer 
                    science. They help us organise data properly and solve problems faster by using the right approach. 
                    Understanding DSA makes it easier to break problems into smaller parts and think logically.

                    Most companies look for students who are strong in DSA because it shows how well they can understand 
                    concepts and write efficient code. Topics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, 
                    greedy and dynamic programming are the basics every developer should know.

                    use every day. It includes the front-end part which deals with the look of the website and the 
                    back-end part which takes care of data, logic and server-side operations.

                    Tools like HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the basics for building the user interface. Frameworks such 
                    as React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB help in creating complete full-stack applications. Nowadays 
                    almost every company needs websites, so web development has become one of the most popular fields.

                    AI helps machines make decisions, ML allows them to learn from data, and Data Science helps in 
                    analysing and understanding large amounts of information.

                    technologies and a lot of exciting career opportunities.
